      "transcription": "The building in which you are standing is the skyscraper known as the Urquinaona Tower. It stands in Plaza Urquinaona, and was designed by architect Antoni Bonet between 1968 and 1970. With its twenty-two floors and its octagonal ground plan that takes full advantage of all the space available at the corners, it is eye-catching for its prismatic forms finished in glass and dark-hued ceramics. Bonet chose that color because it stands up well to urban pollution and the passage of time. When this observation point was refurbished, the walls were covered with rust-colored panels, the same size as the ceramic panels on the façade, as a tribute to the architect. The famous steel and leather BKF chair you can see in this room, popularly known as the buttefly chair, was also designed by Antoni Bonet. The Urquinaona Tower is considered a skyscraper because seventy meters, two hundred and thirty feet, is a considerable height for Barcelona.\n\nNone of the city's buildings stands taller than the a hundred and seventy-two meters, five hundred and sixty-four feet, envisaged for the height of the central tower at the Church of La Sagrada Família, still under construction. Antoni Gaudí set that limit in order not to rise higher than the work of God, represented in Barcelona by the a hundred and seventy-three meters, five hundred and sixty-seven feet, of Montjuïc Mountain, and no architect has ever dared to exceed it. The Urquinaona Tower is an office block, but its top floor is crowned by the unlimited Barcelona scenic viewpoint, a space that can only be visited on Sundays and bank holidays. On weekdays, the upper floors of the building are leased out for work meetings and events. This activity is handled by a company called The 19th Hole Barcelona."

      "transcription": "On the far side of the city, next to the sea, you can see a cliff-like promontory. That is Montjuïc, Barcelona's biggest urban park. It is a place that has played a very important role in the city's history. Archaeological remains have been found at Montjuïc, confirming the existence of human settlements there from the end of the Neolithic period, four thousand years ago. There is also evidence that the hill was occupied by Iberian tribes in about the fourth century BC. It was them who gave the city its first name, Barceno. Later, at the end of the first century BC, a Roman walled city was founded on Mount Taber, a small eighteen-point-nine-meter, sixty-two-foot elevation, very near where Barcelona Cathedral stands today. Over time, the name Barceno was Latinized, and the city came to be known first as Barcino and then as Barcelona. Montjuïc Mountain was also the scene of two great events that transformed the city: the International Exposition of 1929 and the 1992 Olympic Games. The exposition brought with it the development of the whole hillside and the construction of several monumental buildings, including the Palau Nacional, or National Palace, which now houses the MNAC, the National Art Museum of Catalonia. You can see the outline of the palace to the right of Montjuïc Mountain. The preparations for the 1992 Olympic Games saw the building and refurbishment of many sports facilities and infrastructures throughout Barcelona. Behind the Palau Nacional, you can see the Calatrava Tower, a Z-shaped communications tower designed by architect Santiago Calatrava. And if you look beneath the tower, you can also see the dome of the Palau Sant Jordi, the sports venue designed by Arata Isozaki. Further down, you can see two big fountains. They are located in the Plaza Catalunya, the city's nerve center and the starting point for such famous thoroughfares as the Ramblas and the Paseo de Gracia."

      "transcription": "The Ciutat Vella, or Old City, at your feet is the heart of Barcelona. As its name indicates, it is the oldest part of the city. Its perimeter is marked by the medieval wall that used to protect and delimit the city. Outside the walls, it was forbidden to erect any buildings within cannon range, a distance of just over a kilometer, nought point six miles. The city was encircled by walls until the second half of the 19th century, and this kept its inhabitants tightly packed inside. In fact, Barcelona is still one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with sixteen thousand people per square kilometer, even more than cities like New York, Tokyo, and London. L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, one of the municipalities that make up the Barcelona metropolitan area, is the most densely populated urban area in Europe. From here, you can see two Gothic buildings, both dating from around the fourteenth century. In the middle, you have the cathedral. It stands on the site formerly occupied by a Romanesque cathedral, which in turn built on top of a pre-Romanesque basilica. A little to the right of the cathedral, there is the bell tower of Santa Maria del Pi, a building immediately recognizable for the enormous rose window on its main façade. The window has a diameter of more than ten meters, thirty-two feet."

      "transcription": "The city's medieval wall used to run past this very spot in front of Plaza Urquinaona. In fact, one of its six gates was in Calle Junqueras, just opposite where you are now. Many years later, in 1936, building work also started here on the fifty-six-meter, a hundred and eighty-four-foot Fabregas Building. The Fabregas Building is easy to spot. It's the enormous pink and cream-colored building you have in front of you. Apart from the Urquinaona Tower, it's the tallest building in this quarter of the city. Named after its first owner, it is considered Barcelona's first skyscraper. The man who designed it, architect Lluís Gutiérrez Soto, was a keen follower of rationalist art deco tendencies. As you can see, even today, the building continues to captivate with its curved lines and cream ship-like appearance. Visible above the left-hand side of the Fabregas Building, you can see the Church of Santa Maria del Mar, known as the Cathedral of the Poor. It was built in just fifty-four years, thanks to the economic support and collaboration of the people living in this maritime quarter. The city's other cathedral, more commonly identified as Barcelona Cathedral, was built in the same period, but with funding from the church and the nobility. Now look up towards the sea. On the right side of the city's shoreline, you will see another of Barcelona's most emblematic skyscrapers, the a hundred-meter, three hundred and twenty-eight-foot Hotel Bella, designed by architect Ricard Bofill. And if you follow the line of the seafront further to the right, you will be able to see the huge cruise ships anchored in the harbor, just where the statue of Christopher Columbus marks the beginning of the famous Paseo de las Ramblas."

      "transcription": "In the second half of the 19th century, Barcelona underwent a process of intense industrialization. The city walls were knocked down, and industrial facilities and housing for workers began to be built outside the old walled part of the city. This process gradually extended to the towns and villages on the plain surrounding Barcelona, integrating them into the city. The Gracia, Sants, Poblenou, and Sant Andreu quarters all bear the names of what were previously towns in their own right, and they all retain a defiant sense of their own identity, customs, and popular celebrations. We encourage you to discover these other Barcelonas if you can. Some vestiges of this period of industrialization can still be seen today, like the long 19th-century chimneys, which continue to stand as silent witnesses to that process."

      "transcription": "If you look out towards the seafront, you can't miss the two tallest buildings in Barcelona. They are two almost identical towers, each of which stands a hundred and fifty-four meters, five hundred and five feet tall. The one on the left is the Mapfre Tower, the one on the right, the Hotel Arts. Immediately to the left of them, and also facing the sea, other buildings were erected to house the 1992 Olympic Village. Strangely enough, prior to 19992, Barcelona only had around two hundred meters, six hundred and fifty feet, of beach suitable for bathing. Today, it has more than four kilometers, nearly two-point-five miles of beach. Facing the two towers, just behind the seafront, you will find the Parc de la Ciutadella, a park that was built following the demolition of the military citadel from which it takes its name. It was designed by architect Josep Fontiserè as a venue for the Universal Exposition of 1888. Rising up in the middle of the park, you can see the red-brown roof of the Parlament de Catalunya, the Catalan Regional Parliament. Further down to your right is the Castell dels Tres Dragons, a remarkable castle in the Catalan modernist style, designed by architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner. During the 1888 Exposition, it served as a café restaurant. If you follow the line of trees away to the left of the castle, you will see the court building designed by Enric Sagnier, and a little further to the left, you can just make out the Arco de Triomfo or Triumphal Arch. This, too, was built for the 1888 Exposition. It led to the fair's main entrance. If things had turned out differently, we might well now be looking at the Eiffel Tower instead of an arch. That's right. Gustave Eiffel wanted to build his tower on that very spot, but his proposal was turned down for being extravagant and excessive. Fortunately, a year later, it was accepted in Paris. On the seafront, just to the right of the park, stands the Torre d'Aigües de Catalana de Gas, or the Catalan Gas Water Tower. This beautiful example of Catalan modernist architecture was built in 1906, not long after the Exposition."

      "transcription": "You now have before you one of unlimited Barcelona's most sought-after views. From here, you can see two works by Antoni Gaudí. The first is the Basilica of the Sagrada Família, majestically rising up amid the cityscape. Gaudí took on the Sagrada Família project in 1883 and devoted the rest of his life to it, working on it concurrently with other projects. When he died, he had built only four of the 18 towers the basilica will have when it's finished in about 2026. To find the second work by Gaudí, look down from the Sagrada Família at the first line of buildings beneath it. There you will see an undulating cream-colored rear façade with gray window shutters and a triangular patio. That striking Catalan modernist building is the Casa Calvet. It was the first building Gaudí built in the Eixample quarter, and one for which he won the first prize in the nineteen hundred edition of the Annual Artistic Buildings Competition. Now look to the right of the Sagrada Família until your eyes come to rest on an impressive rocket-shaped tower. That is the one hundred and forty-four meter, four hundred and seventy-two-foot Torre Glòries. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it was inspired by the idea of a water geyser, the shape of the towers at the Sagrada Família, and the rounded summit of Montserrat mountain. Some people also find it very similar to the Hotel Attraction, a skyscraper Gaudí planned for New York in 1909. That hotel was never built, but if it had been, it would have been the tallest building in the world at that time, with a height of three hundred and sixty meters, one thousand one hundred and eighty-one feet. What a pity!"

      "transcription": "Barcelona is possibly one of the easiest cities in the world to find your way around in. The locals often use the terms on the seaside, on the mountainside, Llobregat, and Besòs to describe where they are in the city. Tibidabo Mountain, to the northwest atop the Serra de Collserola ridge, is the point of reference for the mountainside. The seafront marks the seaside, and the two rivers, Llobregat and Besòs, mark the city's southwestern and northwestern boundaries respectively. The Eixample Quarter, the result of a city planning project designed by civil engineer Ildefons Cerdà, is another reason why it is so easy to know where you are in Barcelona. This urban expansion plan was launched in 1860 after the city walls had been knocked down. The Catalan term for expansion is eixample, hence the name of what is now the largest quarter in the city. The Eixample project, also known as the Plan Cerdà, established a gridiron layout with blocks of buildings a hundred meters, three hundred and twenty-eight feet square, streets twenty-five meters, eighty-two feet wide, and houses with six stories. It also called for landscaped patios inside each block. Unfortunately, this last feature was never put into practice, although efforts are now being made to recover some of those interior green spaces. If you look down, you can see how the Calle Roger de Llúria leads up through the Eixample towards Gaudí's Park Güell. Like most of the streets in the Eixample, it is flanked by trees. It is estimated that there are a million and a half trees in Barcelona, including those in the Serra de Collserola."

      "transcription": "From this vantage point, you can see a lot of private and communal roof terraces. For the people of Barcelona, rooftops have always been a place for socializing. They used to go up to hang out the washing, and on special days, such as St. John's Eve, they would organize dinners up there with their neighbors. In those days, there were no tumble dryers, lifts, or air conditioning. Concierges used to live in small apartments on the roof, while the wealthier residents used to live on the first floor, which was known as the main floor. Now it is just the opposite. Penthouses with terraces are the most sought-after properties. Above all the roof terraces, you can see Mount Tibidabo. It forms part of the Collserola Nature Park, a protected area of more than eight thousand hectares that acts as the lung of the city and its surroundings. Prominent at the top of the mountain and overlooking the city is the Church of the Sagrado Corazón, designed by architect Enric Sagnier. At its feet lies the Tibidabo Funfair, one of Europe's oldest funfairs. The idea to build the fair was put forward in 1899 by pharmacist Salvador Andreu, better known as Dr. Andreu. To the left, you can see the impressive Torre de Collserola, a communications tower designed by architect Norman Foster. It stands two hundred and eighty-eight meters, nine hundred and forty-five feet tall. Finally, we invite you to look to the left and to the right and try to pinpoint where Barcelona ends. It's an almost impossible task, isn't it? That's because Barcelona's boundaries are indistinguishable from those of its many neighboring towns and villages. The Barcelona metropolitan area includes thirty-six municipalities and has a population of approximately three point three million people. Before saying goodbye, we would like to thank you for contributing to the El Lindar Foundation, because a full ten percent of your admission price will go directly to the El Lindar School. El Lindar is a non-profit-making foundation which each year counsels and accompanies four hundred teenagers and young people in situations of exclusion from the educational and social system. The foundation helps them in their transition to adult life, offering them the opportunity to practice the skills they need to reenter the education system with a better chance of success or to break into the employment market. You can find more information about El Lindar at www.ellindar.org, or by clicking on the link on the Unlimited Barcelona webpage. And that is the end of your visit to Unlimited Barcelona. We hope it has helped you to see Barcelona from a new visual and historical perspective, and we hope it has aroused your curiosity about a city which, as you have seen, is really many cities in one.
